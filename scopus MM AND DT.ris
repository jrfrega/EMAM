AB  - The utilization of on-premise technologies in the business environment is ushering in a new era known as digital transformation (DX). Although organizations are aware of the potential advantages of DX, they have faced problems creating a clear path to reshape their existing processes in line with on-premise technologies. Therefore, they need guidance from a holistic viewpoint. Maturity models (MMs) are developed to guide organizations by providing an extensive roadmap for improvement. The digital transformation capability maturity model (DX-CMM) is developed to assist organizations by providing current DX capability/maturity determination, derivation of a gap analysis, and the creation of a comprehensive roadmap for improvement in a comprehensive, structured, objective, complete, and standardized way. The aim of this study is to check the usability and applicability of the DX-CMM by performing a multiple case study, including assessments of the DX maturity level and derivation of a roadmap for DX maturity improvement to move one level further in two organizations in the chemical and machine manufacturing domains. The case study results show that the DX-CMM is applicable for identifying the DX maturity level, and it is capable of providing a roadmap for DX maturity improvement for moving one DX maturity level further, as well as benchmarking organizations evaluated using the same approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Under the scenario of the fourth industrial revolution, the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the day‐to‐day business of small and medium enterprises (SME) entails expected challenges. Focusing primarily on more advanced levels of maturity, the existing maturity models are inadequate for assessing companies with low maturity levels, such as most of existing SMEs. A framework for a maturity model tailored to SMEs is proposed in this paper, allowing for a comprehensive and high granularity assessment of these companies’ maturity levels, which then eases their integration into this industrial revolution. The proposed holistic model considers all Industry 4.0 dimensions while being detailed enough in its initial levels to properly assess SMEs at the same time. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - SMEs are seen to have a hard time integrating the fourth industrial revolution. The purpose of our investigation is to grasp the impact that SMEs inherent limitations have on their integration in Industry 4.0. For this, we performed a 3 months full immersion investigation in a traditional manufacturing SME to assess such limitations (which are accountable for engendering obstacles). We present two digitalization propositions to showcase how simple digitalisation might set a company on the right track towards Industry 4.0. Both case studies display paths to increase the level of digitalization of an enterprise as it is a basic requirement for companies to enter this industrial revolution. Following this research's methodology will allow companies to be more aware of their current state of Industry 4.0 maturity and carve their way into this fourth industrial revolution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to substantiate the basic principles and prerequisites for the formation of project maturity of public administration for the successful implementation of digital governance projects. The relevance of this study is due to the need to implement the task of digital transformation of Ukraine by solving the problem of modernization of public administration on the basis of constant increase of project maturity of the organizations.The study proved the existence of a direct dependence of prospects for the implementation of digital transformation projects on the level of project maturity of public management. A variant of the project maturity model adapted to the local self-government body is being developed. The model assumes three levels of maturity of local governments. It has established that the majority of the created united territorial communities of Ukraine were characterized by the first two levels of maturity. The implementation of the maturity model makes it possible to assess the current state of the system, choose adequate tools for staff training, create conditions for continuous improvement and realization of the potential of the local community for the implementation of digital transformation projects. © 2021 University of Tehran.

AB  - Purpose: Recent research has shown that the implementation of Industry 4.0 requires companies to (re)adjust their human resource (HR) policies. This article focuses on the relationship between Industry 4.0 and three HR practices: i.e. employee involvement, job design and skill development. Design/methodology/approach: We use data of the European Company Survey (ECS) (2019). This nationally representative survey in the EU28 gathers data on workplace practices among managers from establishments employing at least 10 employees. We focus on 5,609 establishments in the manufacturing sector. Findings: Firstly, employee involvement shows a strong positive correlation with Industry 4.0, irrespective of the digital technology used, country or firm size. Secondly, weak but significant correlations are found with increasing job complexity and skill development. Research limitations/implications: Research should engage in fine-grained analyses of the alignment between particular digital technologies and their respective HR practices. Practical implications: Our results stress the importance of involving employees during the implementation of Industry 4.0. Originality/value: Despite frequent acknowledgement across Industry 4.0 roadmaps and maturity models, the predictions for HR practices are empirically incomplete and theoretically inconclusive. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Goal: Industry 4.0 has the main purpose of turning the company into an agile organization and adapting continuously to the market's dynamicity. Thus, to reach this target, the business should be aware of its current readiness level and establish digital strategies to reach higher levels. This research aims to explore how improvements in industry 4.0 can improve companies' business processes. Design / Methodology / Approach: The present study is action research that initially identified the most suitable maturity model in Industry 4.0 in the scientific and practitioner literature. Furthermore, the chosen model was applied to a beverage manufacturer to evaluate its current maturity level. Some Industry 4.0 improvements were implemented on the warehouse as part of the company's digital strategy into which it was integrated the inventory management system with new digital solutions. Finally, interviews were conducted, and data was gathered from company indicators. Results: The action research’s conduct revealed its current status and how storage management contributed to its digital transformation process. A phenomenon of islands of improvement is discussed at the end. Limitations of the investigation: Our main limitation is our case study approach. Additionally, more interviews crossing functional areas could bring additional elements about the perception of improvements that each functional group had at the implementation process. Practical implications: The case study suggests that maturity models' applications can generate the phenomena of islands of improvements. Managers must take this situation into account to plan digital transformation in the whole company. Originality / Value: The phenomena of the island of improvement is suggested to be a side effect of implementing industry 4.0 based on maturity models. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia de Producao.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As the digital economy evolving as a nation-level strategy of China, firm decision-makers have shown increased interest in implementing digital transformation. However, they lack strategic guidance towards the realization of digital transformation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the status quo of Chinese firms' digital transformation. METHODS: We fulfill this task by combining qualitative and quantitative methods. First, a conceptual model and an associated survey tool are developed based on an in-depth literature review and field practitioners' opinions. The status quo of digital transformation is decomposed into 5 dimensions. Second, empirical survey data collected from 282 Chinese firms are analyzed and interpreted both in general and across industry types and ownerships. RESULTS: We find that the majority of Chinese firms reach a consensus on the strategic importance of digital transformation and agree on the importance of technological and human resources. In general, firms in the information technology sector scored higher in all five dimensions compared with firms in the manufacturing sector, and private-owned firms scored higher in all five dimensions than state-owned firms. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study set a basis for the development of a maturity model of digital transformation and offers practical insights for Chinese firms to initiate and implement digital transformation projects. © 2021-IOS Press.

AB  - As airports undergo digital transformation, ie a paradigmatic shift in the way digital technologies are adopted and used, there is a need for actionable insights to ensure that airport digital maturity is achieved. Using an integrative review of literature, this paper develops an airport digital maturity model, focusing mainly on a passenger experience perspective. The paper then delineates two dimensions of digital transformation — technological and organisational. Subsequently, an airport digital transformation model is conceptualised to identify key factors that airports need to consider when transforming their business and interesting lines of enquiry for future research. Insights offered by the model are relevant to both practitioners and researchers interested in conducting future studies in this area. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.

AB  - Digitalization is playing a prominent role in cultural economics reshaping GLAM organizations toward a more relevant income generation. However achieving a higher level of digitalization requires careful management and resource planning. To this end, the concept of digital maturity provides a useful description of an organization current level of digitalization, allowing for a more effective digital transformation process. The literature concerning business studies and information technology developed highly detailed surveys to assess digital maturity levels within organizations, the so-called digital maturity models. Nevertheless, while many of them are manufacturing-based, very few are wide-spectrum models allowing for a generic assessment of digital maturity. This paper provides a preliminary descriptive analysis on the aptitude of Italian and Campania GLAMs for deploying digital facilities and services, thus suggesting the need to elaborate a specific digital maturity model for GLAM organizations. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Purpose: In recent years, the development and application of innovative and disruptive technologies in manufacturing environments is shaping the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to describe a tool to assess the maturity level in implementing Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies in manufacturing companies. Design/methodology/approach: Using a framework to develop maturity models found in literature, three main steps were taken: the model design from the literature review on industry 4.0 and the comparative analysis of existing models; interviews with engineers and managers of relevant industries; and pilot tests in two relevant industrial companies. Findings: The proposed maturity model has 41 variables considering five dimensions (organizational strategy, structure and culture; workforce; smart factories; smart processes; smart products and services). The studied companies showed different levels of Industry 4.0 implementation. According to respondents, the model is useful in making an initial diagnosis and establishes a roadmap to proceed the implementation. Practical implications: Empirical evidence supports the relevance of the proposed model and its practical usefulness. It can be used to measure the current state (initial diagnostic and monitoring assessments), and to plan the future desired state (goal), identifying which transformational capabilities should be developed. Originality/value: The literature review did not return an enough complete maturity model to guide a self-administered assessment. Therefore, the proposed model is a valuable tool for companies and researchers to understand the I4.0 phenomenon, plan and monitor the transformation actions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The University of Mauritius (UoM) established as a traditional face-to-face university has been engaged in distance education since 1993 and in e-learning since 2001 to establish itself as a dual-mode institution. In a context where it has engaged itself to promote its internationalization of online courses and a digital learning transformation process, there is a need to assess and evaluate its current e-learning capability to identify areas of good practices and opportunities for improvement to ensure a high quality of e-learning provisions. The paper reports the results of an assessment of the e-learning capability and the related quality assurance processes of the University of the Mauritius using the e-learning Maturity Model (eMM). Quality assurance in higher education is still a key issue, especially with the ever-growing influence of technology and the disruption that the Internet has caused with respect to e-learning and distance education provisions. No university in Mauritius has ever engaged in such an assessment of their e-learning capabilities. Design/methodology/approach: The EMM and the Open Learning Consortium Quality Scorecard Suite were found to be the most complete models in terms of available documentation and description of how to carry out the evaluation with respect to each process area as compared to the other models described in the literature review section. The EMM was, however, chosen as the model to be used for the UoM, given that there already exists a body of knowledge about its applications in different universities that operate in similar contexts. The researcher is at the heart of the process in the role of an ‘eLearning quality auditor’. Therefore, the research used mainly desk studies, and analysis of annual reports as well as a consultative approach with key stakeholders based on a consensus model to reach a rating for each element in the EMMv2.3 instrument. The rating is based on evidence that is available and verifiable through desk research and documentation. Findings: We found out that the main strengths of the university were in the learning process areas mainly because of the need to follow existing quality assurance procedures in place at different phases of a course of life cycle, irrespective of the course modality. On the other hand, across all process areas, the university fared well in the delivery dimension, and this finding is consistent with other universities that were assessed using the EMM. However, it was found that the EMM in current form was more adapted for the assessment of universities operating fully as open or virtual universities rather than those operating as dual-mode institutions or as traditional universities promoting technology-enabled learning. The weakest link was the optimization dimension across all process areas, and the process area that needs more attention for improvement was the evaluation process area. Overall, the university can reasonably be pitched at level two (Repeatable) of the capability maturity model scale used for information systems maturity assessment, but operating towards level three (Defined). Originality/value: The work presented here has never been carried out for any university in Mauritius, and there have been no reported evaluations or applications within the African region. It allows the university to benchmark and compare its standing with respect to other universities operating as dual-mode institutions and as a reference for other universities in Mauritius as well. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: E-business maturity models have been widely used to guide the process of digital transformation of business. However, these models have been criticized for their predominantly technocentric approach, which is poorly suited for SMEs. The purpose of this paper is to produce a holistic, nonlinear e-business development model for SMEs that takes into account the interactions of the organization in the pursuit of its business objectives. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the literature review, this paper proposes a nonlinear digital development model for SMEs that factors in the interactions between digital technologies and organizational processes. The model is applied to three cases using a qualitative research approach. Findings: The analysis of the cases demonstrates how the model recognizes that SMEs have an agile and flexible operating structure and reduces the role of technology in order to refocus the entrepreneurs on the relationship among business goals, organizational capabilities and communication requirements. Practical implications: The proposed model helps the business owners to clarify and better understand what kind of interaction levels exist between the relevant actors in the pursuit of the firm's goals and to identify the best mix of digital and nondigital communication methods to support their work. It also assists policymakers to overcome technological bias when assessing the current state of play of e-business development in the SME universe and formulate actions that support the development of digitally oriented SMEs. Originality/value: This paper proposes a novel, nonlinear, interaction-based development model for SMEs in order to complement previous technocentric models focusing mainly on a mechanist perspective of e-business maturity models. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study develops a dynamic capability-based framework of maturity assessment through combinative capabilities towards smart manufacturing transformation. First, the relationship between existing maturity models and dynamics capability is investigated. The finding indicates that most maturity models cannot identify an organisation’s dynamic capability or examine this capability in a dynamic and competitive environment during the transition. On the basis of the literature and senior executives’ experiences, this study incorporates dynamics capability into the maturity model assessment developed by the Singapore Economic Development Board for empirical analysis and identification of the importance of key capabilities with influencing factors, which are included in a framework to fill the research gap. Primary data obtained from in-depth interviews are systemically examined to determine the industrial maturity level and dynamics capability driving the transformation. Drawing on this investigation, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for smart manufacturing transformation driven by dynamic capabilities that have positive effects on the transformation of manufacturing enterprises. Our main contribution is identification of the four key aspects of dynamic capability–process, technology, organisation, and transformation. Another contribution is that we provide dynamic capability-based guidance for enterprises to re-evaluate their strategies and strengthen the capabilities they require to face a changing environment. © KOSIME, ASIALICS, STEPI 2020.

AB  - The formulation and implementation of a digital transformation strategy have become a key concern for many pre-digital organizations. Consequently, there is a fundamental need to support companies in the transition to the use of technologies and to guide them to improve their capabilities in a standardized, unbiased, and repeatable manner. The paper goal is presenting the first proposal for a Digital Transformation Maturity Model (DTMM) that meets the needs and challenges of the customer experience and is aligned with the characteristics of the credit unions. The methodology used is divided into six steps, starting with a systematic review of the literature on the subject, continuing with a semi-structured interview with experts in digital transformation, and then carrying out an information gathering with experts in the cooperative sector. All the above to validate the proposal of the dimensions and maturity levels associated with the MMTD. The results obtained are an MMTD structure for the cooperative sector with seven dimensions (1) Strategy, (2) Organization, (3) Customer, (4) Ecosystems, (5) Operations, (6) Technology, and (7) Innovation and their respective components. Also, five levels are proposed to evaluate the maturity of each dimension, Pioneers (Level 5), Optimized (Level 4), Integration (Level 3), Enablement (Level 2), Initiation (Level 1), and Not initiated (Level 0). © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

AB  - Due to Industry 4.0 technologies, small-and medium-sized enterprises have a great opportunity to increase their competitiveness. However, the question remains as to whether they are truly able to implement such modern technologies faster and carry out digital transformation. The main aim of the paper is to classify small-and medium-sized enterprises into various groups, according to the level of implementation of Industry 4.0, using the Index of Industry 4.0. Based on the results of the cluster analysis, the small and medium enterprises are categorized into four different groups, according to the level of implementation of Industry 4.0. There are top Industry 4.0 technological enterprises, I4 start enterprises, noobs enterprises, and I4 advances enterprises. So far, the largest group consists of the small-and medium-sized enterprises that are just starting out with the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as IT infrastructure, digitalization (data, cloud, data analysis, and information systems), and sensors. On the other hand, the top I4 technological enterprises group is the least numerous. The analysis carried out comparing the smalland medium-sized enterprises with the large enterprises shows that the SMEs still have a lower level of Industry 4.0 implementation. This confirms the assumption that the large enterprises have greater opportunities to use new technologies and transform them into smart factories. However, this situation may change in the future if new technologies become more accessible, and SMEs are worth investing in Industry 4.0 in terms of the return on investment. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Digitization is said to strongly disrupt business and professional life. Especially tax consulting has aroused public interest in this respect. Frey and Osborne (2017) even go so far as to predict that tax consulting will become obsolete. Although these statements are misleading without further interpretation, there is no denying the fact that some change in the accounting and tax profession is inevitable. In Germany, however, business digitization currently does not seem to be urgently necessary in the tax consulting field since this profession is protected by law from competition. Thus, by examining the digitization efforts of German tax consultants we are able to exclude almost all effects of outside pressure and therefore take a look at intrinsic motivation. This study focuses on psychological factors and explores the relationship between tax consultants' Big-Five personality and their level of digitization. Personality is measured using the ten-item Big-Five inventory provided by Rammstedt and John (2007). We develop a digital maturity model based on 20 questions relating to digitization in business and tax consulting. After carrying out a factor analysis, five factors are extracted. To interpret our results, we develop two business model transformation indices as well as an overall digitization index. Our analysis is based on a survey of 968 members of the chamber of tax consultants (Steuerberaterkammer) in Munich, Germany. We are able to show that tax consultants scoring high on extraversion and openness to experience and low on neuroticism exhibit a higher level of digitization. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to discuss intrinsic motivation and digitization in an accounting context. Moreover, an index for digitization as a whole and two business model transformation indices are provided, shedding light upon a hard-to-grasp phenomenon. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Exposed to ongoing digital transformation, companies are able to exploit opportunities offered by Industry 4.0, and are forced to manage immanent risks and barriers. However, studies on opportunities and challenges relevant for the implementation of Industry 4.0 for companies are scarce. In response to this literature gap, the aim of this exploratory research is to provide a deeper analysis of the level of digital transformation of companies in Serbia based on a digital maturity model, and examine their managers' opinions on the most important driving forces and implementation barriers. The paper uses exploratory research design based on a survey responded to by 122 high-level managers within the Serbian manufacturing sector. Findings show that, contrary to expectations, digitally transforming enterprises do not see human resources as a driving force, but rather as an obstacle to Industry 4.0 implementation, when they lack necessary competences and skills. Resistance to change caused by Industry 4.0 implementation is not seen as an important barrier. On the other hand, efficiency factors represent the main driving force, while the lack of competences and financial resources represent the greatest barriers to Industry 4.0 implementation. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The construction industry is embracing the digital transformation to streamline the process from design to build. However, compared with design companies, precast concrete (PC) companies seem to be slow in the adoption of building information modeling (BIM). The paper thus intends to (1) understand the current BIM maturity levels in these companies via a survey among the PC companies; (2) develop a model for identifying critical success factors (CSFs) influencing BIM adoption from PC companies' view; and (3) give recommendations to the PC companies as well as policymakers. From the survey responses of 53 respondents from the PC industry in various countries including Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, China, Korea, Taiwan, the Middle East, and Finland, the study successfully identified a total of eight CSFs, which are regarded as the main contributions this research makes to the body of knowledge. Based on these CSFs, recommendations are provided to assist PC companies to become industry innovators. Some additional contributions are (1) a new BIM adoption model, which is a mix of a BIM maturity model and a BIM adopters' model and acted on by driving forces; (2) a new framework (called "PCBIM Hexagon" by the authors) consisting of driving forces from six areas: The government, ecosystem, company, team, process, and BIM software tool; and (3) a new approach for ranking the importance of the factors. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The adoption and integration of digital technology in organizations are crucial not only for communication, administration and management, but also a meaningful asset to support learning and teaching as well as organizational change. However, existing models of educational technology adoption and integration predominantly focus on school settings as well as on individual factors explaining the assimilation processes. Therefore, this research intents to fill the gap of a holistic model of technology adoption in educational organizations through developing a theoretically grounded maturity model. In a case study, the maturity model of technology adoption was implemented in an European educational organization. The study included N = 222 employees in two waves of data collection. Findings indicate a positive attitude towards IT and digital media within the respective organization. Overall, the educational organization was classified as digitally pragmatist. It is suggested that maturity model development should be highly transparent, following a clear methodology. Model evaluation and validation should be carried out before transfer and generalization can take place. Factors mediating digital maturity and organizational performance on individual (i.e., motives, attitudes) and on organizational level (i.e., organizational culture) should be taken into consideration. For successful technology adoption processes, organizational and human resource development ought to go hand in hand, supported by a sound communication strategy. © 2019, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.

AB  - The article presents a comparative analysis of maturity level in Industry 4.0, of Brazilian companies with German Industry, seeking to identify learning opportunities to increase competitiveness. It was used the maturity model in Industry 4.0 developed by VDMA (German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association), applied to German companies, serving as benchmark. The same model was applied to Brazilian companies, from the State of Espírito Santo, located in the most developed region of the country, but with lower industrial density, and which has great challenges to increase its participation in the national and international markets. A field research was carried out with 46 industries, which participated in workshops to understand the fundamentals and to evaluate the maturity level in Industry 4.0. The individual results were processed by the platform of VDMA, indicating the levels in six dimensions of the model and the general result on a scale of 0 to 5. The results of all companies were tabulated, allowing the comparison with the research carried out with German companies. The study showed that, on average, Brazilian companies have the same level of maturity of German companies in readiness for Industry 4.0, with grade 0.9 in a scale of 0 to 5. But, there are significant differences in compared dimensions. 5.6% of German companies are at the advanced level in Industry 4.0, especially the technology developers, while Brazilian companies studied are still at the most basic levels. Both Industries are skeptical about investments in Industry 4.0 and the level of evaluation on Strategy dimension is still low. The comparison of expectations and difficulties allowed identify essential points to support these companies to follow the way to Industry 4.0. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.

AB  - Digital transformation is a strategic transformation process, built on two main founding bases; firstly, identifying the dimensions of a company's digital transformation, secondly, the digital pre-transformation multidimensional assessment. This paper introduces the development of a multidimensional digital pre-transformation valuation system, proposing to start this exercise by assessing the ICT dimension. The approach adopted in this work consists in identifying the evaluation criteria, defining measurement tools for these criteria, in order to deduce the ICT maturity levels. The findings present a triaxial ICT assessment model. The model axes are access, content and use. These axes represent the criteria to be qualified, by a questionnaire, in order to identify the ICT maturity level of a company. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

AB  - Digital Transformation (DT) is the journey of using digital technologies to develop new business models and strategies. DT aims to achieve competitive advantage and to realize activities that will create efficiency in the corporate value chain. Digital Maturity Model (DMM) provides a practical approach to DT. There is a need for an analytical tool to analyze the significance of the factors in the DMM and to rank the companies according to their digital maturity. It is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem with multiple factors under vagueness and impreciseness. Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTS) is a technique used to facilitate Decision Makers' (DMs) judgment process in imprecise situations. HFLTS technique gives DMs possibility to use linguistic expressions with comparative judgments. This article introduces a decision framework based on the HFLTS, Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic (HFL) Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and HFL Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS) methods. It is aimed to provide a scientific method that helps to determine the most important criteria for companies' DMM and to rank companies. A case study about the banking sector is presented to verify the usability of this method. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Digital transformations are changing society, and they force industries to react to the market more frequently. Managers are aware of new technical demands, which increase the pressure of meeting those demands. To meet technical demands, radical innovations are one way to stay competitive. However, it is more complex to make them a part of the business. The purpose of this study was to create a framework for small and medium-sized enterprises to become more efficient by starting to digitalise their business processes with the expertise of an external innovation partner. Design/methodology/approach: The study was performed at a case company with an abductive approach where both deduction and induction were used to study the empirical findings and formulate new theories in relation to recognised theory. Qualitative methods have been used in the empirical study due to their flexibility and the fact that the focus of the information gathering was to create a context. Findings: The analysis indicates that a certain level of process maturity can be put in relation to a certain innovation level and a certain level of digital change. According to a process maturity model, an adaptable process could respond to changes in customer demands better, which can be related to changes in the business domain and the society. The research resulted in a conceptual cooperative model based on the three domains of the study. The model has been validated using design reviews with the case company, a consultancy firm and together with an innovation partner. Practical implications: The model will be a practical template for Small and Medium Enterprises to follow when digitalising business processes and how to prioritise them. Originality/value: The proposed framework of how to digitalise at different innovation levels coupled to process maturity levels is a novel idea that could be used for further research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - There is focus among most leading academic institutions globally to understand digital transformation. While most operate on some common premise related with the construct of digital transformation there is no established definition yet. Existing descriptions cover a wide range of things from smart living, future of work, automation, industry convergence, and technology among others. These are sometimes fairly all encompassing, inconsistent and incomparable as a point of reference. Interestingly, major consulting firms, technology promoters, independent influencers, analysts promote transformation solutions, each with their own models, interpretation and descriptions. In the paper, we develop an understanding on what is the nature of demand for digital transformation. This is based on evidences of narratives from large financial institutions. We scoped our study on four large banks in North America to see — is there an essence of transformation when institutions adopt digital technology? The paper deals on key themes — drivers, benefits, perception of digital transformation, readiness of banks and deployment instances. Understanding how large financial institutions are adopting digital technologies is important for contemporary technology providers, institutions, researchers and analysts. The study conducted is qualitative along with associated quantitative techniques and visual analytics. This is achieved by theme-based narrative analysis of the public disclosures from four large North American Banks across five years (FY’13–FY’17). The research analyzes the relevant narratives from annual reports to code them into logical themes thereby providing a view of the key focus and associations. Analyzing the practices and manifestations of the institutions this research classifies standard and more advanced differentiating practices. This leads to an emergent structure for a Digital Transformation Maturity Model (DTMM). The authors believe these will serve as indicative maturity guidance for digital technology adoption by financial institutions, in similar context and will also be beneficial to technology providers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Digital transformation in health care is being driven by the need to improve quality, reduce costs, and enhance the patient experience of health care delivery. It does this through both the direct intervention of technology to create new diagnostic and treatment opportunities and also through the improved use of information to create more engaging and efficient care processes. Objective: In a modern digital hospital, improved clinical and business processes are often driven through enhancing the information flows that support them. To understand an organization's ability to transform their information flows requires a clear understanding of the capabilities of an organization's information technology infrastructure. To date, hospital facilities have been challenged by the absence of uniform ways of describing this infrastructure that would enable them to benchmark where they are and create a vision of where they would like to be. While there is an industry assessment measure for electronic medical record (EMR) adoption using the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Analytics EMR Adoption Model, there is no equivalent for assessing the infrastructure and associated technology capabilities for digital hospitals. Our aim is to fill this gap, as hospital administrators and clinicians need to know how and why to invest in information infrastructure to support health information technology that benefits patient safety and care. Methods: Based on an operational framework for the Capability Maturity Model, devised specifically for health care, we applied information use characteristics to define eight information systems maturity levels and associated technology infrastructure capabilities. These levels are mapped to user experiences to create a linkage between technology infrastructure and experience outcomes. Subsequently, specific technology capabilities are deconstructed to identify the technology features required to meet each maturity level. Results: The resulting assessment framework clearly defines 164 individual capabilities across the five technology domains and eight maturity levels for hospital infrastructure. These level-dependent capabilities characterize the ability of the hospital's information infrastructure to support the business of digital hospitals including clinical and administrative requirements. Further, it allows the addition of a scoring calculation for each capability, domain, and the overall infrastructure, and it identifies critical requirements to meet each of the maturity levels. Conclusions: This new Infrastructure Maturity Assessment framework will allow digital hospitals to assess the maturity of their infrastructure in terms of their digital transformation aligning to business outcomes and supporting the desired level of clinical and operational competency. It provides the ability to establish an international benchmark of hospital infrastructure performance, while identifying weaknesses in current infrastructure capability. Further, it provides a business case justification through increased functionality and a roadmap for subsequent digital transformation while moving from one maturity level to the next. As such, this framework will encourage and guide information-driven, digital transformation in health care. © 2020 Universitetet i Oslo. All rights reserved.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to present contemporary developments in the field of digital maturity models. By conducting a systematic literature review finally 24 relevant studies including 22 different models were identified and various characteristics of different digital maturity models were extracted. Focus was placed on the dimensions used to measure digital maturity in different model approaches. Special light was shed on organizational culture and to what extent it is represented in the models. Among other things, the findings indicate, that dimensions applied in various models can be very different and that just a few models incorporate transformational in addition to digital capabilities. In particular, organizational culture as a dedicated dimension of digital maturity is represented already in a few models, which indicates the growing importance of culture as an enabler of digital transformation efforts. Beside a comprehensive overview of the most widely used dimensions measuring digital maturity, a synthesis of the most frequently addressed cultural attributes is presented in this paper as well. This review finally reveals that most of the existing models give an incomplete picture of digital maturity, that cultural attributes reflecting a digital culture are not integrated systematically, and that digital maturity models specific to the domain of services are clearly under-represented. It also clearly demonstrates that research about digital transformation maturity as a holistic concept is scarce and needs more attention by research in the future. © 2019 Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno.

AB  - The digital transformation of the production sector is setting the scene for a major industrial change. The need for supporting companies in this transformation is currently covered by several maturity models, generally operationalized through standardized questionnaires, which provide, as an outcome, an assessment of the current maturity stage and a set of general improvement recommendations according to it. However, to provide companies with a more tangible support, there is a need for more individual approach. In order to deal with this need, this paper proposes, following a design science research framework, a novel approach based on Problem-Based Learning for structuring the assessment procedure as a dialectic process. This approach aims at facilitating the contextualization of the assessed company and, consequently, the identification of context-specific improvement recommendations. The proposed approach, supported by a maturity model used for framing information collected during the assessment process, is tested in three industrial cases. Although these have been assessed at the same maturity stage, different improvement recommendations have been proposed according to contextual factors such as strategic goals, core processes and key performance indicators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Digital business transformation is a priority for Russian companies in all industries. To develop a company to its full value in the digital environment, it should include an IT department capable of meeting business needs. Evaluation of the current state of the IT department in terms of digital transformation will determine the company’s potential for further development. This article presents a solution to the problem of assessing the IT department’s readiness for digital business transformation by developing a quantitative assessment of the maturity level of the IT department processes for meeting the needs of the enterprise. The approach to solving this problem consists in the joint use of models for assessing the digital maturity of the enterprise as a whole and models for assessing the maturity of the IT department processes and herein is the scientific novelty of the results obtained. At the first stage of the study, based on the analysis of modern information and digital management practices, as well as on the study of approaches to assessing the digital maturity of the enterprise and the processes of the IT department, we developed the requirements for the IT department maturity model of digital business transformation. The study identified the prospects for IT departments that affect its maturity level, developed a model for quantifying each perspective and a model for calculating the minimum level of maturity of the IT department to achieve the expected assessment of the company’s digital maturity. To assess the willingness of IT departments to digitally transform business, a regression equation of IT department maturity level is constructed from the influencing prospects (factors). The results of approbation of the model are presented. © 2020 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.
