AB  - The primary purpose of this article is to present a maturity model dealing with environmental manufacturing processes in a company. According to some authors, Industry 4.0 is based on characteristics that have already been the focus of “lean and green” concepts. The goal of the article was to move from resource consumption, pollutant emissions, and more extensive manufacturing towards environmentally responsible manufacturing (ERM). Using environmental materials and methods reduces energy consumption, which generates cost savings and higher profits. Here, value stream mapping (VSM) was applied to identify core processes with environmental potential. This paper provides an understanding of the role of environmental manufacturing in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The globalisation recognised in this century engages the third world to a strange competitive economic environment. The Moroccan Government highlights some emergency decisions to support the small and medium enterprises (SME) like decrease taxes and facilitate enterprise creation cost and procedure however those actions remain insufficient toward the external promotion reflected on delay, quality and cost of products and services. Hence, emergence of lean manufacturing system (LMS) came to resolve this problem by improving productivity and management system. However, for many manufacturers, especially SME, these concepts stay very difficult to implement and maintain. In this perspective, this work aims to overcome the optimum steps to install the advanced LSRO model to improve both productivity and performance with low cost. These implementation steps of LSRO model has been proposed through a case study relating basic concepts of LMS and management by objectives (MBO). Nevertheless, few works related to this field make academic research and industry closer, our work falls within this context through the industrial productivity improvement. This paper also proposes some research perspectives aiming to complete this research axis by enhancing the presented model through other industrial experiments and studies. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

AB  - Purpose: Lean manufacturing (LM) has advocated gains by reducing waste and intensifying continuous improvement. As a holistic organizational policy, it must overpass the limits of the manufacturing function. Management accounting should be aligned to lean thinking, aiming to meet the demands and goals of a lean organization. This paper aims to investigate the degree of alignment between management accounting systems and LM practices. Design/methodology/approach: Two representative case studies were carried out in industry leaders in the implementation of LM, in Brazil. The key research constructs and were identified by means of a systematic literature review. The rhetoric and practice concerning the alignment between management accounting and LM are discussed based on the existing theory and the conducted case studies. Findings: The analysis showed that many of the principles that form the rhetoric of lean accounting are far from the accounting practices observed in the companies. Using the theory-building function of case studies, 10 propositions to be tested in future research are proposed. The main propositions are also summarized in a framework based on analogies with optical lenses. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, there are no previous in-depth studies focusing on characterizing this alignment between management accounting and LM practices. The analysis yields prescriptive directions for managers that seek to improve this alignment in their business. This study also proposes a five-stage maturity model, which can be used by the managers to assess this alignment and to set goals for reaching more advanced levels of maturity. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In this science research explosion century, the competitive economic environment and manufacturers are forced to follow the development and changes to protect their existence with respect of delay, quality and cost challenges, therefore lean manufacturing concepts become part of solution. Contrariwise some manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) suffer to implement these concepts. This paper’s purposes are to define an advanced model of lean manufacturing system (LMS) based on ISO:9001 version 2015 principles and VDA6.3 version 2016 norm and suggest a maturity model to evaluate the maturity level of LMS which has been confirmed through statistical studies. Nevertheless, few works related to this field makes academic research and industry closer, our work falls within this context through the industrial productivity improvement. This paper also proposes some research perspectives aiming to complete this research axis by enhancing the presented model through other industrial experiments and studies.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to propose a method for measuring lean supply chain management (LSCM) maturity based on the main lean practices and existing waste of a supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage approach was developed. First, a thorough literature review was performed to raise concepts and previous findings on maturity models (MMs) and LSCM. This review’s outcomes were then validated by experts in the field using the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). Subsequently, the proposed model was illustrated and assessed based on a multi-case study. Findings: All companies attained high outcomes in the elimination of the waste pillar. The pillars of logistics management, continuous improvement and information technology management also stood out in the three organizations’ results. The company with the lowest maturity level operates in a make-to-order production policy, which may harm the lean supply in its supply chain. Practical implications: The proposed model can reveal external opportunities and threats and internal strengths and weaknesses in supply chains (SCs). It is also capable of providing a clear roadmap for SC improvement in companies. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study to date has proposed a MM in the LSCM context using FDM and considering the crucial relationship between lean practices and wastes. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - There are continuing debates on the effects of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and its combination with lean on manufacturing performance. It is suggested to integrate lean production principles into ERP systems; however, research exploring this area in the literature is limited, especially quantitative studies. This study fills the knowledge gap by quantitatively investigating the correlation between ERP-based lean systems and performance outcomes, using a system dynamics approach. We model a manufacturing system, focusing on the effects of ERP and lean inputs on customers' order fulfilment. Different scenarios of ERP systems supporting lean practices are illustrated through a capability maturity model. Actual performance data is collected to validate the developed model. The results show that ERP is a hindrance on lean at the low maturity level. The influence on ERP only occurs with the mediator role of lean. ERP-based lean systems bring substantial benefits to organisations. Therefore, lean practices are a foundation upon which the full benefit of ERP can be received.

AB  - The presence of a performance measurement system (PMS) along with measurement practices has the potential to foster the planning and adoption of Lean practices in a production system. Literature also agrees that a higher Lean maturity status could be correlated to a higher level of operational performance. Thus, novel approaches are needed to identify improvement opportunities for organisational initiatives, such as Lean and PMS implementation practices. However, no studies were found that addressed possible links between Lean and PMS practices in an integrated model. Thus, this paper aims to develop a framework for assessing Lean and PMS maturity in organisations to leverage combined improvement efforts. Firstly, a literature review was conducted to map existent maturity models and parameters for performance management congruence. Then, a framework was structured to connect the findings and correlate Lean and PMS maturity levels. Finally, a pilot application in a company from the chemical sector was conducted to test the framework and gather practical implications and insights. Results illustrate how Lean and PMS can evolve based on congruent improvement efforts. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a maturity model for academic leadership teams to benchmark their ability to deliver a culture of continuous improvement through the use of Lean Six Sigma. Teams will also be able to use this model to develop strategic action plans to improve the culture of continuous improvement within their institution. In addition, this paper explains the journey the authors have taken in creating this model by using a mixture of literature review, questionnaires and case studies to build the model and the use of test cases to refine and improve the model. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a structured approach, focussing first on assessing the state of UK Lean Six Sigma (LSS) implementation and the, through the use of the case study method, the authors have designed a maturity model based on the classic capability maturity matrix approach. The final model has then been tested to refine the model into an improved version. Findings: Key findings from interviewing the academic institutions that make up this paper highlight the current best practice in the UK and how far they still have to travel to become truly continuous improving organisations. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited to only focussing on UK institutions in the design and development of the maturity model. Future research should benchmark UK institutions more formally with international universities from North America and the Far East. Practical implications: This paper present a final maturity model which can be used by academic leadership teams to both map their maturity at delivering continuous improvement projects and to act as an action plan to move the culture towards a quality-based, continuously improving institution. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first such model to be produced focussing on the leadership and sustainability of deploying LSS in academic institutions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - For manufacturers investing in Industry 4.0 technologies could not be enough to be competitive. They also need to assess their actual digital status quo and to evaluate how these technologies support their product development process. Different methods and maturity models exist in literature helping practitioners to evaluate the maturity of either their smart manufacturing level or their design and engineering process and to analyse the wastes along their development process. Nevertheless, a coalescence of these tools is still missing. The paper aims at proposing a systematic and integrated methodology evaluating a company under the two-fold level of digital and lean maturity, also supported by a benchmark analysis. The final aim is to set and adequately ground a PLM project roadmap for companies willing to approach digitisation. Three application cases, business to business engineering to order Italian companies engineering and developing advanced industrial machineries, have been selected to validate the research.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate an effective project management practice focusing on planning and control. By doing so, it contributes to the debate on rethinking traditional project management practices and accentuates the need for adjustments based on the project context. Design/methodology/approach: This paper extends the project management theory by proposing a lean project planning (LPP) and control framework, developed and tested in collaboration with ten engineer-to-order (ETO) companies. By following a design science research approach, elements from lean thinking and current project planning and control practices are combined into a maturity model (MM). Findings: ETO project characteristics are identified, and their implications for planning and control are discussed. Nine enablers that transform current project planning and control approaches into a lean approach are defined, allowing the analysis of the underlying complexity of planning and controlling ETO projects and thus facilitating the determination of the actions required to improve project performance. Research limitations/implications: Once fully embedded in an organization, the presented MM can provide a safe framework for self-criticism and can be used to conduct self-assessments without the need for an external facilitator. Thus, this paper is of particular interest to practicing project managers who aim to implement LPP and control. Originality/value: To the authors’ best knowledge, this paper is the first to empirically examine the journey toward LPP and control from a MM perspective. This research attempts to describe the enablers of LPP and control. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Today, most of the car manufacturers world-wide have embraced the principles of lean manufacturing on strategic and operational level. On strategic level car companies like Toyota (Womack et al., 1990) shifted 63 per cent of the value of the car towards the first, second and third tier suppliers for the co-production and co-development of cars as an effect of lean implementation. However, lean implementation was also followed by for instance Ford and GM in the USA, the latter company faced a sudden disruption in 2009 due to the break-out of the financial crisis in 2008, while Ford survived. Could this be foreseen? The exclusive use of (classic) financial performance indicators may give a false image of a company’s current and future performance. There is a need for a model to identify “the stars and the laggards’ regarding car companies by taking into account non-financial and intangible dimensions as advocated by Neely et al. (2003) regarding the third generation of business performance measurement systems. The purpose of this paper is therefor to propose a method to measure and benchmark car company performance which includes the non-financial R&D dimension as well as supply chain, value creating and employee dimensions. These dimensions are present in the value leverage model (van Blokland et al., 2012a, 2012b) which can serve as a basis for this method. The aim is to contribute to the third generation business performance measurement systems by further development of the value leverage model towards a maturity model for benchmarking car company performance. The proposed method can provide a big picture and give insight regarding company performance and direction of the performance. Design/methodology/approach: Value leverage can be measured by a correlation analysis regarding three dimensions, namely, supply chain, R&D and value creation, all relative to the employee or capita which results in the average value leverage (AVL) factor. This AVL factor can be used to compose a combined relative and absolute ranking. The score regarding the AVL results in a relative ranking expressing the level of stability regarding the car companies value chain and system. For the absolute ranking the car companies receive per variable parameter a score according to their absolute performance relative to the other car companies. The relative and absolute ranking are presented on the vertical and horizontal axes forming a matrix. The matrix is the basis for the stability-value leverage maturity model for measuring and benchmarking company performance. With the proposed method, the following main research question can be answered: “How can company performance be measured and benchmarked from a stability-value leverage perspective?”. Findings: With the proposed method, stability-value leverage performance can be measured. The relative ranking on the vertical axis and the absolute ranking form together a matrix which is presented by a scatterplot. A matrix with four maturity levels emerged from the analysis by introducing the average score of all the car companies together in the data set crossing the matrix vertical and horizontal. The four levels are as follows: Level I, low stability – low value leverage; Level II, low stability – high value leverage; Level III, high stability – low value leverage; and Level IV, high stability – high value leverage. Stability-value leverage performance of car companies can be measured over time which makes it possible to observe to which direction the car company migrates for instance from Level I to Level III, before and after the financial crises in 2008. The car companies BMW, Daimler, Audi, Ford and Honda are the best performing companies in stability-value leverage over the period 2000-2014, as they are situated at Level IV. With the findings, the main research question can be answered. The value leverage indicators can be used for measuring and benchmarking company performance regarding four maturity levels of stability and value leverage. The direction of performance can be observed as well. Research/limitations/implications: This research is limited to the car industry. Further research is devised to test the indicators for instance on the truck manufacturing industry. Further research towards new variables is part of the ongoing research. Practical/implications: With the value leverage maturity model, it is possible to inform stakeholders about stability, value leverage and value creation capability of car companies. Weak performing companies can be identified in an early stage with this method to anticipate for instance on possible discontinuation of a car company effecting in merger an acquisition processes. Social/implications: With the method stakeholders such as employees, users of cars and investors can be informed about how and why car companies perform in an unstable or stable manner. Originality/value: This research towards ranking and classification of car companies aligns with theories regarding lean manufacturing and maturity models, as these models are used to compare companies on their level of perfection or excellence. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper proposes an instrument to evaluate the maturity of lean manufacturing, and to examine the relationship between lean manufacturing maturity and operational performance. The research instrument examines companies’ maturity on eight dimensions, composed of 38 lean practices, based on Toyota’s 14 management principles. The instrument was applied to 90 manufacturing companies located in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. The results confirm that maturity can explain 49.9% of the variance of researched companies’ operational performance (R2 Adj = 0.499). The present study contributes to the expansion of scientific research in the fields of lean production and maturity of organisations, bringing managerial contributions by providing an instrument for self-evaluation of lean manufacturing maturity. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Companies have been under pressure from different sectors of society to make their processes more environmentally sustainable, a fact that drives the joint adoption of Lean and Green production systems. Studies relating these systems have intensified in the past decade and follow a growth trend. However, this can be considered a relatively new field with many gaps to be filled. One of these gaps is found in the agricultural sector, where no studies relating Lean and Green have been identified. The main contribution of this article is to develop a model for the evaluation of the integration of Lean and Green systems (Lean Green Synergy – LGS) through the formulation of a conceptual framework. In order to demonstrate the viability of the model, a case study was carried out on a set of six specialty coffee producing properties, located in the state of Quindío, Colombia. The research carried out provides a non-subjective means to establish the maturity of the Lean and Green systems and establishes 20 metrics capable of providing the information necessary to carry out the LGS calculations. The calculation method described allows the replication of the model and its adaptation to other sectors by defining the appropriate metrics for it, encouraging the joint adoption of Lean and Green systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Development of a maturity model for the assessment of approaches and behavior in the field of incident management of manufacturing enterprises. Due to the high complexity in organization and technology as well as the reduction of time and inventory buffers within the framework of lean production, the susceptibility of the operational processes increases, so that absolute process stability can no longer be guaranteed. With the following maturity model an analysis instrument is presented, which shows the success factors in the field of incident management from the point of view of science and practice and thus creates the basis for a cross-sector benchmarking. © Carl Hanser Verlag, München and Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Industrial firms are facing increasing environmental and societal challenges in order to sustain their processes. The association of Lean manufacturing to Green concerns has therefore grown in both the industrial and academic fields over the last decade. Following on from the "Lean and Green Project", this paper intends to enhance previous studies by giving an implementation structure to a Lean and Green methodology based on the seeking and eradication of wastes in production processes. A state of the art featuring main scientific contributions and industrial best practices of Toyota is presented, followed by an in-depth analysis of the synergies between Lean and Green wastes, and the tools that may eliminate them. The results are gathered and highlighted in an original Lean and Green house. The last section presents a detailed CMMI-based Lean and Green maturity model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, a visual, data-driven operational level lean maturity model is developed. The model can be used to assess level of lean maturity and to compare it to performance results in different axes of manufacturing cells in order to evaluate lean effectiveness. As demonstrated in this paper, to measure effectiveness of lean manufacturing, both inputs (tools and processes) and outputs (performance) are measured separately and analyzed together. A case study is carried out for gathering data, analysis, and explanatory study of results. Qualitative and quantitative data on lean capability and performance of two manufacturing cells is collected using historical data and audit. A scoring system based on the major and minor non-conformances is suggested to quantify the indicators of leanness. Minimum of fuzzy membership values is selected to calculate overall performance. Then, the results of leanness are compared with performance to highlight the gaps of lean effectiveness. Results of the study show that the developed model can be used to measure both leanness and lean effectiveness through assessment of lean performance. The model can be applied by practitioners as a framework to design and develop a company-specific lean maturity model. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.
