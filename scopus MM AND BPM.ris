AB  - Over the last decades, the role of the IT department within an organization has gradually gained importance. Technology has permeated all areas within organizations and nowadays is the cornerstone of almost all business processes. Thus, business-IT alignment (BITA) is considered an essential success factor for almost any organization. Consequently, the evaluation and improvement of this alignment have been growing concerns among researchers and organizations. This study assessed the BITA maturity in a Colombian university, applying Luftman’s SAM (strategic alignment maturity) model. The conducted assessment collected, analyzed, and contrasted perceptions of business and IT personnel. Similarly, the authors investigated the personnel’s perceptions at the strategic, functional, and operational levels regarding the SAM factors. Furthermore, they compared the results with other BITA assessments in educational institutions, Latin American organizations, and worldwide results. Finally, they drew some conclusions that can be useful for practitioners who seek to apply Luftman’s assessment. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, due to a large number of changes in the external environment, as well as increased competition, organizations must actively support business processes. Internal management processes must be constantly improved. To understand whether a company is developing in the right direction, it is necessary to conduct a maturity assessment. The directions of changes in enterprises should be well designed and based on analysis of the gap between the present and expected state definition. The diagnosis for the present state definition should be holistic, reliable and for the expected state-based strategy and goal recognition. Hence, the goal of the paper is to present the methodology of a company’s self-assessment and definition of an individualized improvement strategy to strengthen the company’s ability to thrive and prosper. The paper includes a presentation of the diagnosis methodology based on maturity models and the resilience concept and its validation based on experts’ opinions and a case study. Companies need a diagnosis to know where they are, and guidance to move in the right direction, which makes the results of the research utilitarian. The methodology can be used for self-assessment, benchmarking and designing an improvement strategy. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Context: Rapidly-changing business requirements expect high business process flexibility that can be achieved using service oriented architecture (SOA). This requires enterprises to adopt SOA and assess their SOA adoption maturity to achieve continuous improvement. SOA realization demands service development with varying levels of granularity. Objectives: The research aims to develop a methodical framework for SOA realization based on Welke's SOA maturity model, a model that assumes a methodology dimension. The framework is concerned with formalizing knowledge on how to identify and shape the main building blocks of a method at each maturity level. Methods: The research applies the principles of design science research and method engineering to develop a methodical framework for SOA realization. Results: The research identifies the gaps in SOA realization methods and illustrates how a methodical framework based on a maturity model facilitates the SOA adoption process. The evaluation results revealed that the framework would help enterprises to select method fragments required at each maturity level to accomplish business excellence. Conclusion: The implications of this research are twofold: from a theoretical perspective, the researchers or practitioners can use the results for further study. From a practical standpoint, enterprises can use the methodical guidelines to assess their current maturity level and select and implement the required method fragments from the method base provided in the proposed framework. © 2020

AB  - Business process modeling was suggested by academia and implemented by the industry to trigger device requirements. Maturity models of software processes are also similar in the software industry. Therefore, business software requirement engineering approaches-based process should aim to fulfil with the maturity models. Although researchers in the area of Software Engineering, Project Management, and Business Intelligent have addressed planning and execution and a lot of research still needs to be done, in this study, we focused on doing a questionnaire based on different prominent universities, major companies, and software houses. The purpose of the questionnaire was to dig out the main factors that negatively affect software houses and their products and services, especially in the medical field. A questionnaire was generated to accomplish these reasons, and interviews were conducted to extract the key explanation why software developers and software houses in developing countries are not familiar with the CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) model for medical software projects. This analysis attempted to figure out why the tech enterprises of developing countries are behind foreign competitors. We aimed to determine why software developers do not meet the international requirements for software. The novelty of the research is that attempts were made to strengthen the new approach by adding agile at level 3 to keep the local software industry appropriate and reveal the requirements for medical software life cycle study, because accurate decision support is really necessary for healthcare systems. © 2021 Li Hou et al.

AB  - Goal: Industry 4.0 has the main purpose of turning the company into an agile organization and adapting continuously to the market's dynamicity. Thus, to reach this target, the business should be aware of its current readiness level and establish digital strategies to reach higher levels. This research aims to explore how improvements in industry 4.0 can improve companies' business processes. Design / Methodology / Approach: The present study is action research that initially identified the most suitable maturity model in Industry 4.0 in the scientific and practitioner literature. Furthermore, the chosen model was applied to a beverage manufacturer to evaluate its current maturity level. Some Industry 4.0 improvements were implemented on the warehouse as part of the company's digital strategy into which it was integrated the inventory management system with new digital solutions. Finally, interviews were conducted, and data was gathered from company indicators. Results: The action research’s conduct revealed its current status and how storage management contributed to its digital transformation process. A phenomenon of islands of improvement is discussed at the end. Limitations of the investigation: Our main limitation is our case study approach. Additionally, more interviews crossing functional areas could bring additional elements about the perception of improvements that each functional group had at the implementation process. Practical implications: The case study suggests that maturity models' applications can generate the phenomena of islands of improvements. Managers must take this situation into account to plan digital transformation in the whole company. Originality / Value: The phenomena of the island of improvement is suggested to be a side effect of implementing industry 4.0 based on maturity models. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia de Producao.

AB  - Organizations strive to develop a variety of capabilities to improve and measure business processes. Researchers have used various maturity models to investigate the development of a business process orientation (BPO), and most have argued that such a development comes in stages. Current literature underestimates the interrelationships between BPO capabilities and fails to consider multidimensional or non-linear paths to maturity. To refine the features of maturity models, this study relies on configuration theory to uncover different archetypes for BPO development and quantitatively evaluate them by examining performance differences among archetypes based on a large-scale international dataset. The resulting empirical taxonomy with seven BPO archetypes establishes important performance differences between organizations at a similar maturity level. Besides strengthening the theoretical foundations of BPO and making maturity assessments more multifaceted, the results help organizations give their managerial efforts a focus by enabling comparison with peers in the same archetype and showing various paths for BPO improvement. © 2021, Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.

AB  - Considering the ever-growing use of Hammer model as a prominent process maturity model, it is the necessity to validate it by quantitative methods. In the case study, a statistical sample of 82 processes and 383 sub-processes were prepared by data triangulation (including survey, analysis of organisational documents and interview). Confirmatory factor analysis was used for data analysis. The data confirmed the Hammer's theoretical model as a suitable tool for measuring the maturity of processes. For the case study, the design of the process was the most effective factor and the maturity of processes was slightly higher than the average at 95% confidence level. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to propose a conceptual framework to integrate a maturity model to the supply chain (SC) strategy, in order to understand how a maturity model can be useful in diagnosing and developing the capabilities of SC business processes (BPs) to meet SC's strategy. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed framework was based on an SC strategy framework, in which a maturity model was added in order to diagnose and identify SC process capabilities that need to be developed, per maturity level, according to the type of SC strategy and the competitive strategy. A grid was proposed to analyze the relationship between them. An exploratory case study (multiple cases) was applied to verify the applicability of the model. Findings: Findings indicate that a maturity model can delimit and align, as far as the company needs to reach, the SC strategic interests with the company's competitive objectives. However, some barriers and facilitating factors implicit can impact on this alignment. It is also noted that the maximum level of SC management (SCM) maturity may not be in the strategic interest of the company. Originality/value: Due to the few empirical studies on the value of maturity models, this research contributes to the understanding of the usefulness of an SC process maturity model for the SC strategy. Moreover, the framework can show how a maturity model can serve as a parameter and guide to develop the capabilities of processes, resources and activities to meet the SC strategy and the reach of the competitive strategy. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Legacy systems deteriorate due to changing business practices and recurrent problems such as high maintenance cost, lack of agility, and degraded performance. Modernization is highly desired especially for those organizations where key business processes are managed by legacy systems. During modernizing, two important aspects are usually ignored, i.e., the transformation of a legacy system to an enterprise solution, and considerations of quality concerns. This overlooking leads to a modernized information system that partially achieves the expected outcome. In this paper, we propose a Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Compliant Modernization Framework (CCMF) that addresses the problems of legacy systems by modernizing to an enterprise system in order to meet the expectations of stakeholders. CCMF is compatible with CMMI Level 2, which is a world-renowned software process improvement standard. Our proposed framework consists of eight distinct stages containing best practices with expected outcomes that are compliant with the specific goals of CMMI Level 2. The framework is based on various strategies that ensure the seamless modernization of legacy systems. Our contributions are twofold. First, it supports the modernization of outdated legacy systems to a more reliable enterprise solution. Second, it is compliant to CMMI standard with due consideration of quality and reliability concerns of the evolved modernized systems. The usability, scalability, and usefulness of the framework are validated by expert judgment on an industrial case study. Our proposed framework is also applicable for change-resistant companies with monolithic systems. © 2021, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Strategic planning of information technology is one of the concerns for new organizations. This paper is the result of a research project in the field of IT strategic planning in Kermanshah Electric Power Distribution Company. Based on the common view of all strategic planning models, one of the important steps is to determine the status of the organization in the area in question. Given the notifications of upstream documents, such as the Tavanir Information Technology perspective document and the e-government document that are necessary to implement, as well as governance approach in this documents, this approach in the service sector has used as Kermanshah Electric Power Distribution Company vision. Based on the vision, Capability Maturity Model Integration and Information Technology Infrastructure Library best practices have been used to determine the current statues. To achieve the purpose of the article, four phases are considered. In the first phase which is the phase of recognition, business processes are recognized. The second phase is the matching of business processes with standard processes of Information Technology Infrastructure Library. For this purpose, initially, business processes were examined form the standpoint of information architecture and then the match was done by conducting specialized interview based on the process. In the next phase, organizational maturity is determined in two ways. In the first method, initially, descriptive phrases are determined by extracting the features of ITIL best practices and delivered to process officials in the form of 27 questionnaires for 27 processes. In the second method that has its own standard questionnaire, the questionnaire is completed for all of ITIL processes. The results of examining the existing situation using best practices as well as standard processes of maturity model indicate the maturity level of the processes based on the percentage and provides the ability to compare the two methods. In addition, based on a comparative analysis of these two methods, the weaknesses and strengths of the organizational processes adapted to the processes of the Information Technology Infrastructure Library were determined, and some recommendations and suggestions for future research in this area were presented. The results show that service desk, event management, request fulfilment, configuration management, and contractor management processes as organizational strengths and change management, knowledge management, information security management, release and deployment management processes as organizational weaknesses issues can be investigated and were not regularly seen in other processes such as service level management, demand management, capacity management. © 2020 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

AB  - Background: Nowadays, organizations try to improve their performance by focusing on the business process orientation (BPO) perspective. This perspective views companies as a mixture of unified business processes. A few methodologies can be used for analysing BPO maturity state. The maturity model shows the level of acceptance of the process-oriented approach in the business practice of a certain company. Recognizing different BPO levels can help companies execute, improve and manage their processes. Objectives: The primary aim of this research is to give a report on BPO maturity of Croatian companies and to stress the importance of key turning points. Methods/Approach: The cluster analysis method was used to analyse the survey results. Results: Croatian companies are currently evolving from the Defined level to the Linked level of BPO maturity. Conclusions: The results of the cluster analysis have shown that companies in Croatia have to improve all key turning points, with a special emphasis on the strategic view. © 2020 Sciendo.

AB  - Indonesia is facing a number of independently managed challenges related to the collection, transportation, processing (composting, recycling), and landfill dependence on waste management. An intervention is needed to bring stakeholders together to solve these waste challenges. The objectives of this study are to investigate the fundamental issues and opportunities and to develop a sustainable and smart country-wide waste management system using industry 4.0 technologies. The system should provide a multi-dimensional approach, determine the maturity level of the waste management system in a technical method, and pursue the goal of designing a new strategy to minimise waste management problems. A comprehensive systematic literature review, intensive focus group discussions, and direct observation in Indonesian cities were approaches used to develop waste management business processes and their system design. Waste business processes consist of mixed-collecting, sorting, transporting, varied-treatment, and chained-disposal. The design of the proposed waste management system presents circular economy processes that can separate municipal waste, identify waste characteristics, and determine sustainable waste treatment technologies through the use of Internet of Thing (IoT) as the integrator. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Good health, and wellbeing (SDG 3); Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13). The study proposes a new design of smart and sustainable waste management which could achieve satisfactory economic, social, and environmental waste management performances. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Germany is experiencing a long overdue paradigm shift in technology and management. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) is not just an application but a basic technology encompassing a company's many functions and activities. Business models, stakeholders, processes, and management are all influenced. The competitiveness of companies also depends on the extent to which interdependent industries mutually accelerate the implementation of AI. In this article, we introduce 'AI-driven management.' Immediate and disruptive use of AI in management can help organizations gain competitive advantage. AI-driven management can substitute for domain-fixed - functional - expertise. © 1973-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Aim Excellent organization of the internal processes is essential for a well-functioning health care system. Particularly, the process of treatment and interaction with the patients is important because the perception of treatment and interaction has a direct relation to the patients' satisfaction. The latter has a strong influence on the recovery of the patients. The impact of the maturity level of the treatment and interaction process on patient orientation is investigated at the example of an extensive survey of hospital managers in Ukraine. Method The analysis is based on an empirical data collection conducted with hospital managers and their deputies in a large Ukrainian city, which is acknowledged as a 'model city' with regard to a comprehensive health care reform in the country. By means of the Business Process Maturity Model (BPMM) we have tested our hypothesis that a high level of process maturity leads to a high level of patient orientation. For this purpose, we have developed a scale for measuring the level of process maturity and have checked the method on validity and reliability. A total of 79 hospital managers and deputies, who represent all public health care facilities of the city (hospitals, primary care clinics, etc.), participated in the study. Results The study reveals a clear relationship between the level of maturity of the treatment and interaction process and the level of patient orientation of the respective health care facility. The variance, which is explained by the independent variable process maturity level, is 16.3 %. All formative dimensions have a strong significant influence on the construct patient orientation. Likewise the maturity level of the treatment and interaction process shows a strong significant influence on patient orientation. Conclusion For health care facilities it is of great importance to achieve a high maturity level of the treatment and interaction process to live up to the claim of being patient oriented. The maturity of the process can be tested using the questionnaire developed in the course of our study. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Well-founded measurements are of high value because a better connection between business process management (BPM) and maturity models (MMs) improves an organization’s performance. Although MMs are appropriate tools for organizations to manage their business processes and, therefore, enjoy popularity, most of these models suffer from their foundation, validation and/or capability coverage. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue by providing metrics to measure and manage business processes. Design/methodology/approach: A high-standard and multistaged procedure was followed to systematically develop and validate the measurement instrument involving international academics and practitioners across four continents. Different rounds were used for item identification, item selection, item revision, instrument preparation (pretest and pilot) and instrument application using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The instrument measures 4 main capability areas, 13 subareas and 62 items. The work explains how to conduct BPM assessments in a more theoretically sound way and reports on the instrument’s development to show high levels of construct validity, content validity and reliability. Research limitations/implications: The author provides a rigorous and more evidence-based instrument, facilitating the BPM discipline’s need of empirical research. Practical implications: The author proposes parameters to configure the instrument. Originality/value: Serving as a reference framework, the instrument strengthens BPM’s empirical and theoretical foundations. Since the instrument is free for scholars and practitioners, the author illustrates the research streams and business situations in which the instrument can be applied (in full or in part). This paper paves the way for transforming the instrument into an optimization MM with advice or improvement paths, bridging the gap between theory and practice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the current business process management (BPM) maturity models meet the requirements of evaluating organizations in the knowledge economy (KE) which manage processes in a dynamic way. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a content analysis of the OMG (2008) Business Process Maturity Model and ten research papers on the practical application of business process management maturity models was conducted. The nature of the study is descriptive and based solely on information from secondary data sources. Findings: The research results reveal that the current BPM maturity models do not correspond with the knowledge-based organizations and take into account knowledge-intensive (usually dynamic) processes in a very limited way. That is why the adaptation of the current BPM maturity models to the KE is needed. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the BPM theory and practice in two ways. First, it provides an enhanced insight into the requirements of the KE toward BPM and BPM maturity models by distinguishing between static and dynamic processes. Second, it formulates the recommendations on possible ways of adapting the current BPM maturity models to the requirements of the KE. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Logistics and production systems are confronted with a highly volatile business environment, a situation which increasingly pushes common supply chain analytics approaches to their limits. Process mining is an emerg-ing technique to provide insights into business processes as they are being executed. However, the application of process mining in cross-organizational context has not been conclusively researched. In a literature overview, we review a set of 34 papers on the application of process mining in supply chains and classify them according to a three-stage maturity model. We find the majority of academic publications (28 papers) to focus on the construction of cross-organizational process models, 5 publications to derive models for alerting deviations and recommending decision support, and 1 paper to focus on automatic adjustments of the system behavior. Based on these findings, we conclude that the exploitation of process mining will be a key competitive advantage in supply chain management in the upcoming years. This applies not only for the design and management of steady-state supply chains, but also for the rapid adaptation of new solutions in transient systems. © 2020 Logistics Journal: Proceedings.

AB  - The article provides an updated extensive literature review on process maturity. On a general level process maturity could be defined as the degree to which a process is defined, managed, measured, and continuously improved, where the aim of working with maturity is twofold, either to measure the level of maturity in order to compare with other processes or to identify improvement areas. According to the findings of this study there are areas indicating needs of further research. Firstly, the fundamentals of process management seem to be missing when describing the work with process maturity, which could affect the quality of maturity models. A second area of further research is related to the absence of approaches and methods for improving process maturity, since improving maturity is often addressed as 'what' to do, not 'how' to do. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

AB  - Business process management (BPM) is considered a source of improvement for business efficiency and effectiveness, although its correct implementation is a tough challenge to most organizations. In this line, some authors noted how certain organizational culture acts as a precursor of a successful BPM implementation. However, there is insufficient empirical research in this regard. Covering this gap is the objective of the present research. The study adopted a non-probability convenience sampling method to obtain 187 participants who are executives of Peruvian companies. Using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) for the data analysis, we found that oganizational culture is an antecedent that positively influences the success of a correct BPM implementation and has a direct and indirect relationship with process outcomes and maturity. We also identified which elements are most relevant to process success. Based on our findings, it is not advisable that organizations direct their efforts only to the implementation of process management practices, they should also analyse and carry out previous actions to set the right organizational culture conditions. This study shows evidence to extant traditional maturity models and consider culture as an isolated antecedent. Besides, it is the first to be developed with data from a Latin American country—Peru. © 2020 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

AB  - Business processes are increasingly becoming technology driven. Disruptive technologies like social, mobility, analytics and cloud (SMAC) and internet of things (IOTs) have made a paradigm shift in the information technology space. With this evolution, the cyber security threats to digital infrastructure also have been increasing manifold and are a concern for the sustenance of business growth scenario. There is a need for a continuous improvement program in the cyber security posture of the organisations to keep pace with the increasing threats. Capability maturity models help to achieve this purpose. This paper presents the formulation and validation of a new cyber security capability maturity model (CSCMM) by comparing the strengths and limitations of nine contemporary maturity models and performing an empirical analysis of inputs from 200 odd relevant cross industry sector professionals. CSCMM is expected to improve the cyber security posture of the organisations to combat to the new generation threats. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Digital transformations are changing society, and they force industries to react to the market more frequently. Managers are aware of new technical demands, which increase the pressure of meeting those demands. To meet technical demands, radical innovations are one way to stay competitive. However, it is more complex to make them a part of the business. The purpose of this study was to create a framework for small and medium-sized enterprises to become more efficient by starting to digitalise their business processes with the expertise of an external innovation partner. Design/methodology/approach: The study was performed at a case company with an abductive approach where both deduction and induction were used to study the empirical findings and formulate new theories in relation to recognised theory. Qualitative methods have been used in the empirical study due to their flexibility and the fact that the focus of the information gathering was to create a context. Findings: The analysis indicates that a certain level of process maturity can be put in relation to a certain innovation level and a certain level of digital change. According to a process maturity model, an adaptable process could respond to changes in customer demands better, which can be related to changes in the business domain and the society. The research resulted in a conceptual cooperative model based on the three domains of the study. The model has been validated using design reviews with the case company, a consultancy firm and together with an innovation partner. Practical implications: The model will be a practical template for Small and Medium Enterprises to follow when digitalising business processes and how to prioritise them. Originality/value: The proposed framework of how to digitalise at different innovation levels coupled to process maturity levels is a novel idea that could be used for further research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Measuring the security of business processes of enterprises has become essential in the wake of different threat scenarios. During the last two decades, a lot of research has been done on metrics for the network security, software system security, attack severity, situation assessment, etc. In the process level, business impact analysis models and security maturity models, as well as well-established risk analysis methods, exist. With the all-pervasive IT implementation of business processes, it has become imperative for the chief information security officers to come up with metrics for the security of business processes in the context of the relevant threat scenario. This paper introduces a novel security metric to assess the business process security, viz., Security Concern. The metric quantitatively measures the 'concern' due to various attributes of the security of a business process in the context of the threat scenario and asset sensitivity. We present the model of the business process, its assets, their dependencies, exploits, and impacts on assets in a top-down fashion. Based on the model, security concern as a metric has been defined. The bottom-up method of the computation of the metric is explained. It is also demonstrated how the proposed metric can be of practical utility for the horizontal and temporal comparison of the business process security. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - While FOSS solutions have attracted a significant amount of attention, alongside with necessary and growing IT related expenditure for the digitalization of public administration, authorities face the question of whether migration to such solutions is feasible and/or worthwhile. The purpose of the presented work is to analyze existing domain research and extract key features, grouped in three major areas (namely Readiness, Ease of Use and Gain from migration), that should be investigated prior to a migration attempt. Following and building upon an extensive survey on Greek municipalities, the latter are categorized via the k-means non-supervised machine learning method to 3 levels of maturity regarding candidate participation in relevant projects. A combined scoring approach, based on similar features of the target FOSS solution as well as the aforementioned municipality categorization, is presented in order to detect a priori good candidate combinations (municipality and software) for minimizing a migration project risk. The method is validated through the aforementioned survey on municipalities with confirmed FOSS usage, indicating that selection in the proposed organized manner can aid in harvesting FOSS benefits. Furthermore, it is compared against a popular maturity model method (BPMMM) in order to comment on the applicability and classification process. © 2019

AB  - Nowadays, every business organization operates in ecosystems and cooperation is mandatory. If, on the one hand, this increases the opportunities for the involved organizations, on the other hand, every business partner is a potential source of failures with impacts on the entire ecosystem. To avoid that these failures, which are local to one of the organizations, would block the whole cooperation, resilience is a feature that multi-party business processes currently support at run-time, to cope with unplanned situations caused by those failures. In this work, we consider awareness of resilience in multi-party business processes during design-time, by focusing on the role of available – as an alternative to unreliable – data as a resource for increasing resiliency, as data exchange usually drives the cooperation among the parties. In fact, a proper analysis of involved data allows the process designer to identify (possible) failures, their impact, and thus improve the process model at the outset. A maturity model for resilience awareness is proposed, based on a modeling notation extending OMG CMMN — Case Management Model and Notation, and it is organized in different resiliency levels, which allow designers (i) to model at an increasing degree of detail how data and milestones should be defined in order to have resilient by-design process models and (ii) to quantify the distance between a process model and the complete achievement of a resiliency level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically evaluate business process orientation (BPO) of the Slovenian power supply business. Design/methodology/approach: Within the empirical investigation, the level of BPO maturity was measured in the 19 organizations of the power supply business. The survey was focused on the top, middle and lower managers. As a measuring instrument, a questionnaire for the extended concept of process orientation with nine elements was used. Findings: The results of the BPO measurement show that, despite this long-standing preoccupation with processes, certified management system and the computerization of operations, process maturity is not high. Particularly the lowest score for information technology represents a surprise. Practical implications: This research makes significant contributions to the literature and above all to scholars and practitioners who work professionally in this field and will find useful guidance for a better understanding of applying BPO and maturity models. Social implications: One important reason for performing the maturity measurement in the power supply business is the importance of its activities for the operation and development and environmental impact of the whole of Slovenian society. Originality/value: Presented research is the first one which considers the BPO maturity in the Slovenian power supply business and therefore contributes to understanding of the “intangible factors” which have impact on the introduction of business process management and BPO. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - E-Government adoption and implementation has gained noticeable momentum across many developed and developing economies. Nevertheless, transitioning from the “electronic” to the stage of “transformational” domain – coined as t-Government – is posing the greatest challenge of how government services respond to changes in the broader economy and society. Despite considerable investments and the wide use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), research literature on e-Government suggests that government services have yet to reach the full potential of seamless integration, where all transactions are completed electronically. Through a detailed analysis of the extant e-Government literature and a case study based empirical research, this paper explores the domain of e-Government in identifying the possible reasons for this potential shortfall in achieving full integration. Furthermore, the paper intends to highlight an aspect of complexity surrounding crossing the integration gap as the authors denote by “eChasm” in the e-Government conceptual model that leads to transformation. In addition, it focuses on radical change through Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and the call for strategic style of leadership, for cross-agency collaboration leading to a successful realisation of transformational government (t-Government). It is interesting to note that researchers and public sector leaders have started to realise that implementing and managing the transformation of public services, copiously satisfying the users and stakeholders, is a task of multi-dimensional complexity. © 2018

AB  - Background: Digital transformation in health care is being driven by the need to improve quality, reduce costs, and enhance the patient experience of health care delivery. It does this through both the direct intervention of technology to create new diagnostic and treatment opportunities and also through the improved use of information to create more engaging and efficient care processes. Objective: In a modern digital hospital, improved clinical and business processes are often driven through enhancing the information flows that support them. To understand an organization's ability to transform their information flows requires a clear understanding of the capabilities of an organization's information technology infrastructure. To date, hospital facilities have been challenged by the absence of uniform ways of describing this infrastructure that would enable them to benchmark where they are and create a vision of where they would like to be. While there is an industry assessment measure for electronic medical record (EMR) adoption using the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Analytics EMR Adoption Model, there is no equivalent for assessing the infrastructure and associated technology capabilities for digital hospitals. Our aim is to fill this gap, as hospital administrators and clinicians need to know how and why to invest in information infrastructure to support health information technology that benefits patient safety and care. Methods: Based on an operational framework for the Capability Maturity Model, devised specifically for health care, we applied information use characteristics to define eight information systems maturity levels and associated technology infrastructure capabilities. These levels are mapped to user experiences to create a linkage between technology infrastructure and experience outcomes. Subsequently, specific technology capabilities are deconstructed to identify the technology features required to meet each maturity level. Results: The resulting assessment framework clearly defines 164 individual capabilities across the five technology domains and eight maturity levels for hospital infrastructure. These level-dependent capabilities characterize the ability of the hospital's information infrastructure to support the business of digital hospitals including clinical and administrative requirements. Further, it allows the addition of a scoring calculation for each capability, domain, and the overall infrastructure, and it identifies critical requirements to meet each of the maturity levels. Conclusions: This new Infrastructure Maturity Assessment framework will allow digital hospitals to assess the maturity of their infrastructure in terms of their digital transformation aligning to business outcomes and supporting the desired level of clinical and operational competency. It provides the ability to establish an international benchmark of hospital infrastructure performance, while identifying weaknesses in current infrastructure capability. Further, it provides a business case justification through increased functionality and a roadmap for subsequent digital transformation while moving from one maturity level to the next. As such, this framework will encourage and guide information-driven, digital transformation in health care. © 2020 Universitetet i Oslo. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measuring Information Technology (IT) Capability is not as easy as measuring others capability, especially on non-IT organization, in term that the organization does not put IT service as their primary business process. This organization, of course, still need IT support, whether from internal IT function or from external organization. In local government organization, usually there is an organization that should support all IT services, which usually called as IT Office. But, practically, it is hard for local IT office to provide all IT service for all organization unit in delivering the business service for the citizen, because of lack of resources. Some of local organizations usually try to provide the IT services by themselves. The others, usually still ask for services from local IT office. This condition put the local IT service in a problem how to assess the capability of the other organizations in IT services so they can set priority in IT services, and give some recommendation to resolve the services request. The aim of this research is to provide the framework for assess the IT service capability of the non-IT organization. The framework uses previous research from Zhang who provide the approach on assessing IT Service Capability in 4 domains, which are IT Architecture, IT Infrastructure, IT Human Resources and IT Relationship Resources. The proposed framework then combined with IT Service Delivery Maturity Model (SDMM) to assess the service maturity. The result of this research can be used as a tool to assess IT services capability. By knowing the IT services capability, the local IT office can have the map of local government IT capability and get some strategy for better IT planning. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to test a model in which the effect of strategic information technology (IT)-business alignment on organizational agility is examined by the moderating influence of environmental uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: This research utilizes a matched-pair survey data collected from 300 IT and business executives working in various privately owned Indian financial enterprises, and structural equation modeling is used to examine the alignment–agility linkage. Findings: The analysis demonstrates the positive effect of alignment on agility (studied as business process and market responsive agilities), and alignment is more effective on business process agility than market responsive agility. However, the moderation analysis reveals that in a highly uncertain environment, alignment has more effect on market responsive agility but not on business process agility. Originality/value: Although previous studies (mostly conducted in the context of developed countries) have reported about the positive IT-business alignment and organizational agility linkage, the literature is silent regarding the influence of external contingent factors on this relationship from a developing country perspective. The authors have conceptualized alignment on the basis of strategic alignment maturity model and meticulously examined its relationship with both categories of agility. This research extends the alignment-agility theory and provides empirical support for this unique association from a developing country (i.e. India) perspective, and thereby, greatly contributes to the alignment literature. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The aim of present study is characterize and compare a series of maturity models for management systems available in the literature and identify feasible use in SMEs. According to reference bibliography, eight criteria are defined for this purpose. They are the domain of application, purpose of use, number of dimensions, number of levels, description by levels, application procedure, graphic style and complexity of use. The results show that Fisher models and the standard ISO 9004 reflect be best for SMEs mainly due to its low complexity of use and its representation in two dimensions, where also specifies the current performance level and it is displays the path of improvement by means of a linear performance profile. In return they do not have a procedure of application and an instrument to relieve data. However, only CCMI and EFQM have a procedure of application but they are more complicated. © 2018, Universidad de Tarapaca. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - With risk management as a key challenge for most organizations, aligning and improving organisational and business processes is essential. Capability and Maturity Models can contribute to assess and then enable process improvement. With the need to integrate risk management in IT Organizations (IT department/organisation), ISO/IEC 15,504–330xx process assessment approach combined with the latest version of ISO 31,000 for risk management can be the foundations for new process models. An integrated process-based approach with various popular and market demands ISO standards (ISO 9001, ISO 21,500, ISO/IEC 20,000–1 and ISO/IEC 27,001) is proposed in the paper; it explains how the Integrated Risk Management Process Assessment Model for IT Organizations in an ISO multi-standards context is developed with a Design Science research method. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Organizations around the world are increasingly concerned about the environment, adopting sustainable practices in their business processes. In the field of Information Technologies (IT) several Green IT practices have been proposed, but in isolation, so a framework is needed if the Green IT is to be implemented and improved in an efficient and integrated way. In this paper, we propose a maturity model (based on ISO/IEC 15504) to help organizations implement the governance and management of Green IT gradually, as well as to improve their maturity level in this area. The validation of this proposal by experts and a case study seems to indicate that the proposal can be useful for implementing and improving the Green IT processes in organizations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to develop a business process maturity model, especially on operation processes, based on the characteristics of each organisational growth stage, to increase small and medium enterprises (SMEs) growth. With this information, SMEs can identify their needs and priorities for business process improvement based on the characteristics that are inherent in the organisation. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model was developed by reviewing the literature on previous studies related to the organisational life cycle and its characteristics, as well as a business process maturity model. Furthermore, historical case studies were conducted to validate the proposed model. Case study objects in this research were fashion industry companies that have grown from an SME scale to national level. Findings: The results of this research indicate that the characteristics of each growth stage are different, which led to increased complexity and maturity of business processes run. Therefore, SMEs should pay attention to their growth stages, as a basis to improve their business process maturity, especially on the critical processes, which are evaluate products performance, design products and services and monitor sales. Through this model, SMEs can determine the business’ current growth stage and use the proposed model as guidance for business process improvement to accelerate organisational growth. Research limitations/implications: Validation of the proposed model was done by conducting a historical case study. To generalise the model, it is recommended to survey similar industry and test quantitatively using statistical methods. However, further research can be used in other industries that might yield different results. Besides, this research can also be developed in the supporting process categories. Practical implications: This study provides a practical guide for SMEs to identify their current growth stage, and implement the measurement of business process maturity level. Maturity level standard at every growth stage can be used in determining the priority of business process improvement to drive organisational growth. Originality/value: Through this research, the BPMM method was developed to enable SMEs to implement a self-evaluation process without seeking external assistance and assess their needs through a clear and understandable scale allowing for further development of the business. By using this method, SMEs can manage their business processes maturity level to encourage its growth. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assist organizations in the assessment of both information technology (IT) and human factors required to support their business processes (BPs) by taking into account the interdependence and alignment of these factors, rather than considering them independently. Design/methodology/approach: A design science research methodology was followed to build a maturity model (MM) enabling this assessment. The proposed design process is composed of four steps: problem identification, comparison of 19 existing MMs in business process management (BPM), iterative model development, and model evaluation. The last two steps were specifically based on three research methods: literature analysis, case studies, and expert panels. Findings: This paper presents a MM that assigns a maturity level to an organization’s BPs in two assessment steps. The first step evaluates the level of sophistication and integration of the IT systems supporting each BP, while the second step assesses the alignment of human factors with the technological efforts. Research limitations/implications: The research was conducted with SMEs, leading to results that may be specific to this type of organization. Practical implications: Practitioners can use the proposed model throughout their journey toward process excellence. The application of this model leads to two main process improvement scenarios: upgrading the sophistication and integration of the software technologies in support of the processes, and improving the cohesion of the resources the organization already owns (human and IT resources). Originality/value: The proposed MM constitutes a first step in the assessment of the interdependence between the factors influencing BPM. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Operational Risk Management (ORM) comprises the continuous management of risks resulting from: human actions, internal processes, systems, and external events. With increasing requirements, complexity and a growing volume of risks, information systems provide benefits for integrating risk management activities and optimizing performance. Business Performance Management (BPM) technologies are believed to provide a solution for effective Operational Risk Management by offering several combined technologies including: work flow, data warehousing, (advanced) analytics, reporting and dashboards. BPM technologies can be integrated with an organization's Planning & Control cycle and related to strategic objectives. This manuscript aims to show how ORM can benefit from BPM technologies via the development and practical validation of a new maturity model. The B4ORM maturity model was developed following the Design Science Research approach. The maturity model relates specific maturity levels of ORM processes with BPM technologies applicable for a specific maturity stage. There appears to be a strong relationship (0.78) with ORM process maturity and supporting BPM technologies. The B4ORM maturity model as described in this manuscript provides an ideal path of BPM technologies related to six distinctive stages of ORM, leading towards technologies suitable for continuous improvement of ORM processes and organization-wide integration. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The goal of this work is to present and explain the differences between internal and external digitisation process instances in the Croatian Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices. The study is to share lessons learned from Agency’s digitisation practice, discuss the applicability of these process instances, and demonstrate ways of evaluating digitisation and accompanying capabilities. The Agency started with digitisation in 2013, and the program ran for four annual cycles. The Agency also established its internal process in 2016. For establishing it, the authors have used business process management methods – interviews, analysis and modelling. For constant process improvement, the authors use capability/maturity modelling methods, focused on the quality component, particular issues and preservation of results. © 2018, Maribor Provincial Archives.

AB  - Business process management is now the most dynamically developing concept in organisation management. In order to further improve process efficiency, it is advisable to analyse the current situation and determine the position of the organisation in terms of its progress in implementing the process approach. This is where the evaluation of the organisation’s process maturity proves useful. And the available literature provides an array of models for such assessment. This paper presents the results of a process maturity study for a selected hard coal mine based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework. The mine was ranked level 3 in process maturity, which is on a par with other Polish businesses. This score suggests opportunities for further improvement towards a more process-oriented business approach. © 2018 Polish Mineral Engineering Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: In order to achieve excellence, outsourced maintenance contractors in Oil&Gas sector play a key role due to the important impact of their task on security, availability and energy consumption. This paper presents the process followed in order to implement a Supplier Development Program in a refinery using Company Maturity Model (CoMM) and the results obtained in three cases validating the method to obtain a strategic improvement project medium term grid. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology followed consists of constructing a CoMM capturing the knowledge existing in the refinery and applying it with three supplier improvement teams. Findings and conclusions have arised through an observation of the three processes and extracting common conclusions. Findings: The resulting CoMM has been used for self-assessment by three suppliers and has demonstrated its potential to define a medium-term improvement project road map validated by the customer. Furthermore, during the design and application processes, the contribution of CoMMs to the SECI process of knowledge management has been observed. Practical implications: The use of CoMMs in a service contractor context can be applied in other sectors. It contributes to alignment of targets between the supplier and customer companies and to knowledge sharing inside both firms. Originality/value: Maturity models in many transversal fields (CMMI, EFQM, BPMM, PEMM, etc.) have been thoroughly studied in the literature. Less effort has been made analysing the case of using maturity models constructed and implemented by a company for its specific purposes. In this paper, the process followed by a company to establish a Supplier Development Process using CoMMs is described. © 2018, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organizations are increasingly becoming realized that the higher the levels of quality of data they use in their business processes, the larger the organizational performance can be. Therefore, it is highly recommended to pay special attention to data quality by institutionalizing a set of the best practices related to the disciplines of data-related disciplines, namely, data management, data quality management and data governance. After investigated on the field, and because of our research, we developed MAMD – Modelo Alarcos de Mejora de Datos-, a framework for assessing and improving the levels of data quality in organizations, in which we aligned and established the relationships between the three disciplines. Our aim was to provide organizations with sound artefacts, which can help them to efficiently implement data-related strategies to achieve adequate levels of data quality, and consequently, better organizational performance. Grounding our proposal on a process-oriented approach, we initially developed two components for MAMD: (1) a process reference model addressing the best practices of the previously mentioned data-related disciplines, and (2) an assessment and improvement model of the level of implantation of these practices. The process reference model is based on the principles of ISO 8000-61, which we complemented by adding specifics on data governance processes, and specifics on data management processes. The evaluation model is grounded on ISO 8000-62, and therefore aligned to ISO/IEC 33000. After having tested the usability of MAMD in several case studies, and after having analysed the conclusions raised from the learnt lessons, this paper describes the changes we introduced to the first version of MAMD to make the framework easier to apply (more easily auditable, and more easily implementable by consultancy). The paper also describes the application of the new version of MAMD to a new case study to check the efficiency of the changes. So, the main contribution of this paper is the presentation of the new version of MAMD. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A key characteristic of the software applications supporting manufacturing business processes is their heterogeneity. This is due not only to differences in their development and deployment, but also to the variety of processes and actors in complex organizations. Heterogeneity at the semantic level is one of the major problems in any process of interoperability and/or integration. There is therefore a need for developing new approaches and methods to ensure interoperability between different software solutions. In the context of a case study with a consortium of MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems) publishers, we propose a semantic alignment process of repositories used in the construction of a MES solution called “MES On Demand”, using multiple applications and driven by business processes. Through the study of semantic heterogeneities, we use an enrichment-based alignment for business repositories applied to ISO/IEC 62264. Finally, we evaluate the contribution of this approach to enterprise maturity in the application of standards and reference models, using Nascio's Enterprise Architecture Maturity Model. This proposal, which is useful for practitioners and experts, is a contribution to academic study on semantic alignment for master interoperability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Effective monitoring and testing during each step are essential for document verification in research and development (R&D) projects. In software development, proper testing is required to verify it carefully and constantly because of the invisibility features of software. However, not enough studies on test processes for R&D projects have been done. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a Test Maturity Model integration (TMMi)-based software field R&D test process that offers five integrity levels and makes the process compatible for different types of projects. The Software & Systems Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) is used widely in the software process–modeling context, but it lacks built-in enactment capabilities, so there is no tool or process engine that enables one to execute the process models described in SPEM. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)-based workflow engines can be a solution for process execution, but process models described in SPEM need to be converted to BPMN models. Thus, we propose an approach to support enactment of SPEM-based process models by converting them into business processes. We show the effectiveness of our approach through converting software R&D test processes specified in SPEM in a case study. © 2017 KSII.

AB  - Maturity models have become important aids to support process improvement. However, researchers have frequently criticized the many business process maturity models (BPMMs) for differing in quality, which creates a demand for comparing and evaluating these models. This paper describes a well-founded, ranked, and weighted set of critical criteria for BPMMs that are most important to prospective users. The paper also demonstrates how this set can serve as a standard or guideline for designing BPMMs. In evaluating the used sample of BPMMs against the set of criteria, we reveal gaps and shortcomings of current BPMMs, make suggestions for raising the quality of BPMMs, and highlight future research avenues. © 2017 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the relationships among absorptive capacity (AC), organisational culture (OC), and software process improvement (SPI) implementation success based on capability maturity model integration (CMMI). Specifically, the aim of this study is to understand the roles of potential and realised AC in SPI success. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a research model and examines the relations among firm AC, SPI success, and OC. The authors surveyed 56 Taiwanese firms that adopted the CMMI-based SPI programme and received official certification. Findings: The findings indicate that potential and realised AC have significantly positive effects on SPI success. In particular, realized (AC) partially mediates the effects of potential AC on SPI success. Furthermore, the effects of potential and realised AC on SPI success are significantly moderated by the adhocracy and hierarchy OCs, respectively. Research limitations/implications: Given that the scope of this empirical study was limited to Taiwan, the findings might lack generalisability; however, this provides an opportunity for future research. Originality/value: This is the first empirical study investigating the influence of AC on CMMI-based SPI success. The proposed research model also examines the moderating relationships of two types of OCs, namely adhocracy and hierarchy, on AC (potential and realized) and SPI success. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The service sector contributes more than 70 % to the GDP of many countries in which their services should continually be innovated to improve customer satisfaction. This study reviews the literature from 1995 to 2014 in the field of service innovation, service experience and engineering, and maturity model. Results show that the existing service innovation frameworks lack a focus on business process improvement, particularly for start-up firms. It causes the startups not ready enough to deal with inevitable challenges that may be encountered in the future. Accordingly, this study proposes a novel framework that combines the service experience engineering method and capability maturity model of integration for service to develop a new innovative service and improve service quality process for start-up firms. A practical case is implemented by applying the proposed framework. A service innovation prototype system is developed on the basis of the case study to deliver a mobile campus merchandise purchasing service. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Nowadays competition has been spread to supply chains, instead of individual enterprises. Therefore, beside evaluation of enterprise’s capabilities to manage business processes, it is important to assess capabilities for business process management at supply chain level. The purpose of the research presented in this paper is to point out the necessity of supply chain management maturity in implementation of best practice. Research methodology is based on supply chain management maturity models. Application of the Delphi method enabled usage of maturity model, adapted to the enterprises in Serbia. The value of the research precedes from unique combination of best practice elements for the assessment of supply chain management maturity level. The research results show that best practice elements are not very popular in the enterprises in Serbia. All enterprises are at the second and third maturity level. Bearing in mind that everything has to be improved continually, maturity models, proposed by different authors can be further developed by including certain statistical tools. The original contribution of this paper and its practical implication refer to including statistical tools, hierarchical cluster analysis and correlation, into maturity analysis, thus enabling creation of framework as a road-map for the improvement of supply chain management maturity. © 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - The digital content industry requires the integration of specialized information and communications technology (ICT) capabilities to support collaborative work for planning and executing its business processes. In particular, this knowledge-intensive industry lacks for adequate control on product documentation, inter and intra organizational resources management, and process monitoring which is required for supporting the high demand of projects typically constrained in time, costs, and quality. This paper presents a defined maturity model named DigiCoMM to assess collaboration and interoperability capabilities that are specific to pre-production, production, and post-production processes within the digital content industry. It also presents MONO, a computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) software for supporting the incremental transition of companies through the different levels of the maturity model. MONO was developed in the context of the DAVID research project (Strategic Programme for the Research and Development of the Colombian Animation and Video Games Industry), during the period of 2012-2015. This model and software were used to assess and support the collaborative capabilities of several animation and video game companies in Colombia. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context The number of maturity models proposed in the area of Business Process Management (BPM) has increased considerably in the last decade. However, there are a number of challenges, such as the limited empirical studies on their validation and a limited extent of actionable properties of these models in guiding their application. These challenges hinder the widespread usage of the maturity models in the BPM field. Objective In order to better understand the state of the research on business process maturity models (BPMMs) and identify opportunities for future research, we conducted a systematic literature review. Method We searched the studies between the years 1990 and 2014 in established digital libraries to identify empirical studies of BPMMs by focusing on their development, validation, and application. We targeted studies on generic models proposed for business process maturity, business process management or orientation maturity, and selected 61 studies out of 2899 retrieved initially. Results We found that despite that many BPMMs were proposed in the last decade, the level of empirical evidence that reveals the validity and usefulness of these models is scarce. Conclusion The current state of research on BPM maturity is in its early phases, and academic literature lacks methodical applications of many mainstream BPMMs that have been proposed. Future research should be directed towards: (1) reconciling existing models with a strong emphasis on prescriptive properties, (2) conducting empirical studies to demonstrate the validity and usefulness of BPMMs, and (3) separating the assessment method used to evaluate the maturity level from the maturity model which acts as the reference framework for the assessment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thailand Qualification Framework (TQF) comprising TQF1 to TQF7, is a national educational compliance requirements for all higher education institutes in which TQF2 is the core document used by others TQF documents. The task of processing TQF documents is a long and tedious work involving many versioned documents with many stakeholders and has to conduct every academic year. This research is conducted to address the problems arisen form the manual processing of TQF documents by proposing a process innovation that can enhance the operations of TQF in reducing time and increasing quality. A process-based transformation of TQF2 based on the general practice of CMMI level 2 and the APQC PCF (Process Classification Framework) into TQF2 PCF processes. A workflow is then designed using BPMN 2.0 standard which can be developed into a TQF2 process-based application supporting the creation and use of TQF2 document. The main contribution is therefore the development of a CMMI-based TQF process definitions and a well-defined workflow to minimize the time and ambiguity in processing the TQF2 document for education assessment. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, the enterprises that develop software have become strategic partners for their clients through value generation, by delivering products that support different business processes. However, there are still problems in software developing projects, like quality. This paper describes the results of the implementation of a quality assurance model that integrates CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration), TSP (Team Software Process) and PSP (Personal Software Process), with the objective to improve the quality of the process and of the software product delivered. The research methodology is a quantitative one, and the investigation design is quasi-experimental about pre-test and post-test. A total number of 22 software projects have been selected to evaluate the model improvements. The results show that there are important improvements in reducing the quality costs and the number of defects. At the same time, the project profitability and customer satisfaction is also increased.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this technical paper is to describe the new approach to the organizational development coming from the mixture of continuous improvement models and business process maturity models. This approach is Organizational Development and the baseline for its application is a standard created by the Central European Association for Business Process management (CEABPM). It is the standard CEABPM 1001:2013 - Requirements for the process-based organization. Methodology: The methodology for creating the new standard for Organizational Development is mostly a literature comparative analysis. Next, we discussed the standard in a sample of academic and business organizations. CEABPM 1001:2013 contains the requirements for process-based organizations as well as the method for quantifying the range of process orientation. Findings: The paper introduces at novel approach to the organizational development based on the systematic management of the organization 's maturity. The basis for this approach is the standard for the organizational maturity assessment: ""CEABPM 1001:2013 Requirements for the Process-Based Organization" together with the methodology of its use as an integral part of the organizational evolution. Practical implications: The standard is intended to work as an assessment tool for the audit of the level of maturity of the organization as well as a knowledge basis for its consequential development at the same time. The audit report as a main output of the organization audit process according to this standard contains detailed information particularly about detected aspects of the identified level of the process-orientation, and about their importance for the further development of the organization. The audit thus results not only in the determination of the level of process orientation, but also in a detailed identification of specific strengths and weaknesses connected with the identified state. © 2016, International Journal for Quality Research.
